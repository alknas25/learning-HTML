      <h2 id="c">C++</h2>
    <p>
      C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup
      as an extension of the C programming language, or "C with Classes". It has
      imperative, object-oriented and generic programming features, while also
      providing facilities for low-level memory manipulation. It is almost
      always implemented as a compiled language, and many vendors provide C++
      compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, Microsoft, Intel, and
      IBM, so it is available on many platforms.
    </p>

    <h2 id="p">Python</h2>
    <p>
      Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language.
      Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its use of
      significant indentation. Its language constructs and object-oriented
      approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and
      large-scale projects.
    </p>

    <h2 id="j">Java</h2>
    <p>
      Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language that is
      designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a
      general-purpose programming language intended to let programmers write
      once, run anywhere (WERA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all
      platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.
    </p>

    <h2 id="h">HTML</h2>
    <p>
      HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language for
      documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by
      technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages
